# Dice Roll Simulation
This is a web-based dice roll simulation that allows the user to input the number of dice to roll and select the sides of the dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) from a dropdown menu. The program uses PHP's built-in rand() function to generate random numbers based on the user's input, and displays the results on the webpage. The output includes the number of dice rolled, the type of dice selected, the total count of the dice rolled, and the details (numbers) of the individual dice rolls. The project also includes basic HTML/CSS to create the webpage structure and styling.
